# OpenFoodFacts

## Project Abstract
Open Food Facts is an open source database dedicated to granting full access to nutritional facts for food items sold all around the world. Over 1.1 million products from 150 countries have been added by over 25,000 contributors by using the Android, iPhone, or Windows app, or their camera to scan barcodes and upload pictures of the product with their labels. Other users can edit previously uploaded food data to provide updates consistent with accuracy. Food data may include ingredients, allergens, nutrients, dietary labels, and much more. Every food item receives a NutriScore from A-E, A being the most healthy and E being the least healthy. Based on the provided data, users are able to compare products with certain brands to make healthier food choices.
